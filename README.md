Hello, I am Lina Bashamakh

I am a third year CS student with a passion for anything that involves problem solving and creative thinking. I have always been fascinated with computers and technology. I like to spend my spare time reading or investing into any of my other creative hobbies (to name some: sketching, painting, and most recently crochet!). My interest in ML piqued during my first year when we took an introductory course; which gave me the opportunity win third place in a coding competition that had ML in one of the rounds!

Really looking forward to this course :)
